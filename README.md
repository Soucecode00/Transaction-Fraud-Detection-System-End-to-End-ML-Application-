## Transaction Fraud Detection System (End-to-End ML Application)

A production-style machine learning system designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions using real-time feature engineering, probabilistic risk scoring, and rule-based decision thresholds.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions process millions of transactions every day.  
Manual review of suspicious activity is slow and expensive, while missed fraud leads to direct financial losses and customer dissatisfaction.

This system is built to:
- Detect high-risk transactions early
- Reduce manual review overhead for fraud teams
- Enable faster, automated fraud decisioning at transaction time
